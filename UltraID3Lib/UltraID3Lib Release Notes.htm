						<ul>
							<li>
							Removed UltraID3ContextMetaDataException and UltraID3MetaDataException.&nbsp; 
							These two classes were used to give context to the ID3 exceptions.&nbsp; For 
							example, if you check the Exception property of an ID3Frame, by definition, you 
							already know what frame caused the exception.&nbsp; But if you instead use the 
							UltraID3.GetExceptions method, you wouldn't have had any context for the 
							exceptions i.e. you wouldn't know if an exception dealt with a particular ID3v2 
							frame or with the ID3v1 tag.&nbsp; I used the above exceptions to wrap the 
							original exceptions and gave them the needed context information.&nbsp; 
							But...this was very confusing to anyone but me...so I rethought the 
							design.&nbsp; What I came up with, I think, is a simple, more elegant 
							solution.&nbsp; I now just extend all exceptions from a base UltraID3Exception 
							which has a Parent property.&nbsp; One can examine the Parent property to get a 
							reference to the instance of the class which caused the exception.&nbsp; For 
							example, if a UltraID3TrackNumOutOfRangeException is returned by the 
							UltraID3.GetExceptions method, you can look at the exception's Parent to tell 
							what caused this exception.&nbsp; If the Parent is the ID3v1Tag, well then, the 
							problem is with the ID3v1 Track Number field.&nbsp; If the Parent is a 
							ID3TrackNumFrame, then you know that the problem is with the Track Number field 
							in the ID3v2 Track Number frame.
							<li>
							Changed the GetFrameCount function to GetMPEGTrackInfo which returns not only a 
							FrameCount property, but an AverageBitRate property as well.<li>
							Added UltraID3UnexpectedException to wrap unexpected exceptions which occur 
							during UltraID3Lib operations.&nbsp; Reading a Frame ID which is not recognized 
							by the ID3 v2 standard would be an expected exception.&nbsp; But if something 
							so totally unexpected happens, such as the tag format being very corrupt on 
							non-standard, that I don't yet check for situation, then I can at least wrap it 
							in another this class to give it some context.
							<li>
							Renamed UltraID3v2UnknownTextEncodingException to 
							UltraID3v2InvalidTextEncodingException.&nbsp; (It wasn't that the text encoding 
							code wasn't known.&nbsp; I knew what it was; it's just that it something other 
							than what it was supposed to be.)&nbsp; "I lost my job.&nbsp; Well, I didn't 
							*lose* my job.&nbsp; I know where it is.&nbsp; They just don't want me there 
							anymore." - Bobcat Goldthwait
							<li>
							Split the UltraID3v2InvolvedPersonException into 
							UltraID3v2InvolvedPersonNameMissingException and 
							UltraID3v2InvolvedPersonInvolvementTypeMissingException.
							<li>
							Changed the access modifier of the ID3v1Tag.Delete method from Public to 
							Friend.&nbsp; This method should only be called from the UltraID3.Write method 
							when the ID3v1Tag.WriteFlag is set to True; not externally.
							<li>
							When reading an ID3v2 tag, the UltraID3TrackNumNotNumericException and 
							UltraID3TrackCountNotNumericException are not throw, but instead are just 
							assigned to the Frame.Exception property.&nbsp; This will allow the rest of the 
							tag to be read.
							<li>
							Some of the exceptions that ended in 'TooLongException' were not inheriting 
							from UltraID3ValueTooLongException, but from 
							UltraID3TrackNumOutOfRangeException.&nbsp; Changed names to end in 
							'OutOfRangeException'.
							<li>
							Changed the UltraID3v1CommentsTooLong28Exception and the 
							UltraID3v1CommentsTooLong30Exception to inherit from 
							UltraID3FieldValueTooLongException.
							<li>
							Renamed UltraID3TagException to UltraID3v2TagException as it was being used 
							exclusively for v2 tag exceptions.&nbsp; In other words, I never threw any v1 
							tag exceptions; the v1 exceptions were all at the field level.
							<li>
							Changed UltraID3v2MissingPictureException to inherit from 
							UltraID3FieldException.
							<li>
							Changed UltraID3v2NonStandardFrameException to inherit from 
							UltraID3v2FrameException.
							<li>
							Changed UltraID3v2NonStandardFrameFormatException to inherit from 
							UltraID3v2FrameException.
							<li>
							Changed UltraID3v2UnableToDecodeFrameYetException to inherit from 
							UltraID3v2FrameException.
							<li>
							Changed UltraID3v2UnknownTextEncodingException to inherit from 
							UltraID3FieldException.
							<li>
							Changed UltraID3v2UnrecognizedPictureFormatException to inherit from 
							UltraID3FieldException.
							<li>
							Changed UltraID3v2InvalidFrameLengthException to inherit from 
							UltraID3v2FrameException.
							<li>
							Created UltraID3FileException.
							<li>
							Changed UltraID3ReadOnlyFileException to inherit from UltraID3FileException.
							<li>
							Changed UltraID3WriteException to inherit from UltraID3FileException.
							<li>
							Changed UltraID3ZeroLengthFileException to inherit from UltraID3FileException.
							<li>
							Changed UltraID3.MPEGInfo property to Read Only
							<li>
							Renamed MPEGInfo to MPEGFrameInfo.&nbsp; To differentiate it from the 
							MPEGTrackInfo.
							<LI>
								Renamed UltraID3.MPEGInfo to FirstMPEGFrameInfo 
								to reflect that this class is not based on the 
								entire file, but instead just the first MPEG 
								audio frame found in the file.&nbsp; An 
								important distinction when considering variable 
								bit rate tracks.</LI>
							<LI>
								Ditched the MS naming standard of dropping the 
								capitol letters in variable names.&nbsp; For 
								example, MS says that MPEGTrackInfo should be 
								called MpegTrackInfo.&nbsp; But it's not 'Mpeg' 
								dammit!&nbsp; It's MPEG!&nbsp; Mpeg is some kind 
								of screwed up word; MPEG is an abbreviation.&nbsp; 
								I really want to follow MS naming standards, but 
								anything that removes information is bad.&nbsp; 
								I supposed they did this to avoid confusion 
								between the last letter in an acronym and the 
								first letter in the following word, but come on!&nbsp; 
								You're either going to know the acronym or the 
								following word.&nbsp; Even if you were not 
								familiar with abbreviation MPEG, would you 
								really think that the MPEGTrackInfo was the info 
								about an MPEGT rack?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Give it a 
								rest MS with this silly standard.</LI>
							<LI>
								Changed the name of KeyValuePair to GenreInfo.&nbsp; 
								(I named it generically thinking that I'd use it 
								for other things, but it turns out I was only 
								using it just for the Genre.)&nbsp; Also, the 
								&quot;Key&quot; and &quot;Value&quot; properties have changed to 
								&quot;Number&quot; and &quot;Name&quot;, respectively.</LI>
							<LI>
								Renamed UltraID3.GenreList to GenreInfos.&nbsp; 
								(More closely matched the new GenreInfo class 
								name.)</LI>
							<LI>
								Changed the name of NameValuePair to 
								LanguageInfo.&nbsp; (I named it generically 
								thinking that I'd use it for other things, but 
								it turns out I was only using it just for the 
								Language.)&nbsp; Also, the &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Value&quot; 
								properties have changed to &quot;Code&quot; and &quot;Name&quot;, 
								respectively.</LI>
							<LI>
								Renamed UltraID3.LanguageList to LanguageInfos.&nbsp; 
								(More closely matched the new LanguageInfo class 
								name.)</LI>

							Fixed bug with ID3TextEncodingFrame tags with data that caused

							Resolved by changing behavior of UltraID3v2UnknownTextEncodingException to a

							<li>

							<li>
							Added the MultipleInstanceFrameTypes enumeration, a subset of the FrameTypes 
							enumeration for frames which can have multiple instances per tag
							<li>
							Changed the ID3FrameCollection.GetFrames(ByVal frameType As FrameTypes) to use 
							MultipleInstanceFrameTypes instead of FrameTypes.&nbsp; (It stands to reason 
							that the only time you would require a return collection is for frames which 
							can exist multiple times in a tag.)

							Removed the ID3FrameCollection.RemoveFirst and the

							delineation between single and multiple instance frame types, I judged these 
							methods to be unnecessary.)
							<li>
							Added Help file comments to all methods of the ID3FrameCollection class.

							<li>
							Big change!&nbsp; For every one of the seventy-four Frame ID's as described in 
							the ID3 v2.3 standard, there is now a specific class.&nbsp; This required the 
							addition of quite a few new classes -- most of which simply have a single 
							String property -- but this change will make it much more intuitive to create 
							new instances of a particular Frame. This change will also allow for easier 
							conversion of existing frames to make them specific to their particular Frame 
							data.&nbsp; For example, the ID3BeatsPerMinuteFrame has a simple Text property 
							(which is a String), where it should be locked down to a numeric value.
							<li>
							Removed FrameInfo class and UltraID3.GetFrameInfo method (as they are no longer 
							required because of above change).
							<li>
							Added FrameName and FrameDescription properties to ID3Frame class (as a 
							replacement for removed FrameInfo).
							<li>
							Renamed ID3Frame.ID to FrameID to match the newly added FrameName and 
							FrameDescription.&nbsp; The "Frame" prefix of the property name is now used to 
							differentiate properties that apply to the frame class as opposed to the frame 
							instance.&nbsp; (I had to use the "Frame" for the Description property of the 
							Comments frame because it already had a Description property.&nbsp; So, to be 
							consistent, I used the prefix for the ID and Name properties as well.)
							<li>
							Split the ID3UndecodableFrame into ID3NonStandardFrame (for frames which don't 
							comply to the ID3v23 standard) and ID3UnableToDecodeYetFrame (for frames which 
							are valid, but where I just haven't yet written the code to decode the frame.)
							<li>
							Fixed bug when setting the Genre field.&nbsp; Due to a tragic cut-and-paste 
							accident, the Artist was erroneously getting set.
							<li>
							Added OwnerIdentifier property to ID3PrivateFrame class.

							Fixed bug where setting the Genre to an empty string would set the ID3v1 Genre 
							code to 0 instead of 255.&nbsp; Genre 0 is "Blues".&nbsp; Genre 255 is used by 
							WinAmp to represent "Unknown".
							<LI>
								Added "missing" Genre codes.&nbsp; (The ID3v1 standards document at <A href="http://www.id3.org/">
									http://www.id3.org/</A>
							did not list genres WinAmp 126 to 147.)&nbsp; Thanks to Cliff Williams for 
							spotting this bug.
							<LI>
							Fixed sort order of Genres list
							<LI>
								Removed ID3v2.Genres property.&nbsp; The ID3v2 standards states you can have 
								multiple genres stored in a single Genre frame, but is unclear on exactly <I>how</I>
								this is done.&nbsp; Besides, the major tag editing tools (WinAmp, MusicMatch, 
								and Windows Media Player) don't support multiple tags either.
